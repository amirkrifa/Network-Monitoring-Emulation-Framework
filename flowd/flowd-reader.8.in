.Nm flowd-reader
.Nd Read, filter and concatenate binary flowd logfiles
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm flowd-reader

.Op Fl H Ar num_flows
.Op Fl f Ar filter_file
.Op Fl o Ar output_file
.Ar flow_log
.Op Ar flow_log
.Op Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a program to read, filter and/or concatenate
.Xr flowd 8
binary log files.
.Pp
If only
.Ar flow_log
arguments are specified,
.Nm
will read each of the log files and print their contents to standard output.
.Pp
Filtering may be performed by specifying a 
.Ar filter_file
using the
.Fl f
option.
In this mode,
.Nm
will filter the flows it reads from the 
.Ar flow_log
file(s) before printing them.
.Pp
Finally, the
.Fl o
option may be used to specify a
.Ar output_path
to which all the flows that have been read and passed any filters are written.
.Pp
The command-line options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl H Ar num_flows
.Xr head 1
mode.
Read only the first
.Ar num_flows
of the file.
.It Fl L
Allows
.Nm
to read legacy version 2 flow logs (generated by
.Xr flowd 8
versions prior to v9.0).
This may be used to convert old flow logs to the newer form.
.It Fl U
Causes
.Nm
to report all timestamps in UTC rather than the local timezone.
.It Fl d
Display debugging information, including the number of filter matches if one 
has been specified.
.It Fl f Ar filter_file
Specify a 
.Ar filter_file .
containing filtering and field selection rules to apply to the flows that are
loaded.
These rules may contain 
.Ar store
directives and filter rules as described in the 
.Xr flowd.conf 5
manual (under the
.Cm Storage field selection
and 
.Cm Filter
sections respectively.)
Any other directives are ignored.
If no
.Ar store
directives are specified in the 
.Ar filter_file
then the default is to preserve all the fields in the input flow logs.
.It Fl q
Operate quietly. If this argment is specified,
.Nm
will not display the flows it is processing.
This may be useful in conjunction with the
.Fl f
option.
.It Fl o Ar output_file
Specify an
.Ar output_file
to which all flows that have been read and have passed any filters are written.
The flows are written in the
.Nm flowd
binary log format.
This option is useful when filtering or concatenating flow log files.
.It Fl v
Reports all information in the flow log, rather than the default brief subset.
.It Fl h
Displays commandline usage information.
