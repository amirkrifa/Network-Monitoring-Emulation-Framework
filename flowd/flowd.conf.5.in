.Dt FLOWD.CONF 5
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm flowd.conf
.Nd NetFlow Collector daemon configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This is the configuration file for the
.Xr flowd 8
NetFlow collector daemon.
All runtime configuration is performed through this file.
By default,
.Xr flowd 8
will use the configuration located at
.Pa @CONFPATH@/flowd.conf ,
though an alterate file may be specified on the command line.
.Pp
The
.Nm
config file is divided into four main sections.
.Bl -tag -width xxxx
.It Cm Macros
User-defined variables may be defined and used later, simplifying the
configuration file.
.It Cm Global configuration
Global settings for the flowd daemon.
.It Cm Storage field selection
This selection specifies which fields from the flow packets are stored in
the on-disk log file.
By eliminating unnecessary fields, the log files may be made quite compact.
.It Cm Filter
The filter section allows filtering and tagging of flows using a matching
language similar to a packet filter.
.Sh MACROS
Much like
.Xr cpp 1
or
.Xr m4 1 ,
macros can be defined that will later be expanded in context.
Macro names must start with a letter, and may contain letters, digits
and underscores.
Macro names may not be reserved words (for example
.Ar listen ,
.Ar accept ,
.Ar store ) .
Macros are not expanded inside quotes.
.Pp
For example,
.Bd -literal -offset indent
internal_network="192.0.2.0/24"
inbound_tag="0x100"
outbound_tag="0x200"
discard quick src $internal_network dst $internal_network
accept tag $inbound_tag src dst $internal_network
accept tag $outbound_tag src $internal_network dst any
.Ed
.Sh GLOBAL CONFIGURATION
There are several settings that affect the operation of the
.Xr flowd 8
daemon globally.
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxx
.It Ar flow source
Specify an address (or network) that
.Xr flowd 8
should accept flows from.
The default is to accept flow packets from anywhere, but if one or
more
.Ar flow source
options has been specified then
.Xr flowd 8
will disregard flow packets from other hosts.
This is separate from the flow filtering language (mentioned below in the
.Cm Filter
section) - packets disregarded at this stage are not subject to any further
processing.
.Pp
For example,
.Bd -literal -offset indent
flow source 127.0.0.1
flow source 192.168.0.0/16
flow source [4000:1::]/32
.Ed
.Pp
This option is optional, if it is not specified then
.Xr flowd 8
will accept flow records from any address.
The use of this option is strongly recommended when flow export protocols
are used that require the collector to retain state information (e.g.
NetFlow v.9 flow templates) in order to avoid flooding attacks.
.It Ar join group
Specify multicast groups to join.
This allows
.Xr flowd 8
to receive multicast NetFlow datagrams.
Both IPv6 and IPv6 groups are supported, IPv6 groups may specify an 
interface scope.
.Pp
For example,
.Bd -literal -offset indent
join group 224.0.1.20
join group ff02::114%em0
join group ff05::114
.Ed
.It Ar listen on
Specifies an address and port on which
.Xr flowd 8
should listen.
IPv6 addresses must be surrounded by square brackets to distinguish them from
the port number.
This option may be specified more than once to listen on mutiple addresses
and ports.
.Pp
For example,
.Bd -literal -offset indent
listen on 0.0.0.0:12345
listen on [::]:12345
.Ed
.Pp
This option accepts the modifier
.Pa bufsize
to allow the specification (in bytes) of the receive buffer for this socket.
If not specified,
.Nm
will attempt to set a large buffer size automatically.
.Pp
For example,
.Bd -literal -offset indent
listen on 0.0.0.0:12345 bufsize 65536
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Cm listen on
directive is mandatory. There is no default value.
.It Ar logfile
Specifies the file in which the received flow records are stored.
The full path to the file must be specified in quotes.
.Pp
For example,
.Bd -literal -offset indent
logfile "/var/log/flowd.bin"
.Ed
.Pp
There is no default value for this option and it it mandatory 
to specify at least one of the
.Cm logfile
and
.Cm logsock
options.
.It Ar logsock
Specifies a path to an AF_UNIX datagram socket that will be relayed flows
in realtime as they are received by flowd.
Please note that this option is experimental.
.Pp
For example,
.Bd -literal -offset indent
logsock "/var/log/flowd.sock"
.Ed
.Pp
This option accepts the modifier
.Pa bufsize
to allow the specification (in bytes) of the send buffer for this socket.
If not specified,
.Nm
will use the system's default buffer size.
.Pp
For example,
.Bd -literal -offset indent
logsock "/var/log/flowd.sock" bufsize 65536
.Ed
.Pp
There is no default value for
.Cm logfile
and it is mandatory 
to specify at least one of the
.Cm logfile
and
.Cm logsock
options.
.It Ar pidfile
Specify a file in which
.Xr flowd 8
will store its process id once it has started up.
For example,
.Bd -literal -offset indent
pidfile "/var/run/flowd.pid"
.Ed
.Pp
The default is to create a PID file in
.Pa @PIDPATH@/flowd.pid
.El
.Sh STORAGE FIELD SELECTION
After filtering,
.Xr flowd 8
stores the flows that it receives in a flexible binary format, which permits
the selection of which fields will be stored on disk.
This enables the flow logs to be made very compact, by selecting only the
fields of interest (this is particularly relevant for high-traffic collectors)
.Pp
The selection of which fields are recorded is made through the
.Ar store
configuration directive.
Each
.Ar store
directive adds the specified field to the store log.
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
store SRCDST_ADDR
store CRC32
.Ed
.Pp
This would store just the source/destination addresses and a checksum per
flow received.
.Pp
The field names supported in the
.Ar store
directive are:
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxx
.It Ar ALL
Store all available fields.
.It Ar TAG
Stores the tag set by the flow filter.
This field must be present for the tags to be recorded.
.It Ar RECV_TIME
Stores the time that the flow was received by
.Xr flowd 8 .
.It Ar PROTO_FLAGS_TOS
Store the protocol, TCP flags and type-of-service (ToS) fields from the
NetFlow packet.
.Pp
Like several other storage fields,
.Ar PROTO_FLAGS_TOS
actually contains several small NetFlow fields together for convenience.
.It Ar AGENT_ADDR
Store the address of the agent that sent the flow to the collector.
.It Ar SRC_ADDR
Store the source address from the NetFlow packet.
.It Ar DST_ADDR
Store the destination address from the NetFlow packet.
.It Ar GATEWAY_ADDR
Store the gateway address from the NetFlow packet.
.It Ar SRCDST_PORT
Store the source and destination ports from the NetFlow packet.
.It Ar PACKETS_OCTETS
Store the packet and octet counters from the NetFlow packet.
.It Ar IF_INDICES
Store the in and out interface indices from the NetFlow packet.
.It Ar AGENT_INFO
Store several fields from the NetFlow packet's header, including the
agent uptime and "wall clock" time and the version of NetFlow in use.
.It Ar AS_INFO
Store the source and destination network Autonomous System (AS) numbers and
network prefix lengths from the NetFlow packet.
.It Ar FLOW_ENGINE_INFO
Store the flow engine type and ID fields from the NetFlow packet.
.It Ar CRC32
Store a per-flow checksum along with each flow record to detect corruption
of the flow log file.
This checksum is automatically checked by
.Xr flowd-reader 8 .
Its use is highly recommended.
.El
Regardless of the options specified by the
.Ar store
directive,
.Xr flowd 8
will always store the time that the flow was received and an integer "tag"
that may be set by the filter system (see below).
.Sh FILTER
.Xr flowd 8
has the ability to
.Ar accept
and
.Ar discard
flow records
based on the address of the agent that sent them or several parameters in the
flow itself.
.Pp
Flows that are accepted may also be "tagged" with a 32-bit unsigned integer.
This is intended to allow basic classification of flows.
For example, this may be used to tag traffic that remains internal to the
local network so that it may be treated specially by a traffic accounting
system.
.Pp
For each flow received and processed by the filter, the filter rules are
evaluated in sequential order, from first to last.
The last matching
.Ar accept
or
.Ar discard
rule decides what action is taken.
.Pp
The following actions can be used in the filter:
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxx
.It Ar discard
The flow record is ignored and is not written to disk.
.It Ar accept
The flow record is recorded to disk.
.El
.Sh PARAMETERS
The rule parameters specify the NetFlow records to which a rule applies.
Most parameters are optional.
If a parameter is specified, the rule only applies to packets with
matching attributes.
The matching sense of some clauses in a filter rule may be negated by placing a
.Cm !\&
operator between a filter keyword and its parameter.
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxx
.It Ar tag <number>
Tag flows matched by this rule with the
.Ar number .
This option only makes sense for
.Ar accept
rules.
.It Ar quick
If an flow record matches a rule which has the
.Ar quick
option set, this rule is considered the last matching rule, and evaluation
of subsequent rules is skipped.
.It Ar agent Xo
.Oo !\& Oc
.Ar <address>/<len>
.Xc
This rule applies to incoming flow packets that are received from an agent
with an address in the specified network range.
NB. this applies to the device sending the NetFlow packet, not the addresses
within the packet itself.
.It Xo
.Oo Ar !\& Oc Ar <inet|inet6>
.Xc
This rule applies to flows whose source or destination address family matches
that specified.
.It Ar in_ifndx Xo
.Oo Ar !\& Oc
.Ar <index>
.Xc
Match traffic whose input interface number matches
.Ar index .
.It Ar out_ifndx Xo
.Oo Ar !\& Oc
.Ar <index>
.Xc
Match traffic whose output interface number matches
.Ar index .
.It Ar src Xo
.Oo !\& Oc
.Ar <address>/<len> Oo port Oo !\& Oc <port> Oc
.Xc
This rule applies only to flows whose source address (as recorded in the
NetFlow packet) is in the specified address range.
.Pp
If the
.Ar port
option is specified, then the rule is further restricted to flows whose
source port number matches that specified.
NB. the port checks are only valid for rules matching TCP or UDP flows.
.It Ar dst Xo
.Oo !\& Oc
.Ar <address>/<len> Oo port Oo !\& Oc <port> Oc
.Xc
This rule applies only to flows whose destination address (as recorded in the
NetFlow packet) is in the specified address range.
.Pp
If the
.Ar port
option is specified, then the rule is further restricted to flows whose
destination port number matches that specified.
NB. the port checks are only valid for rules matching TCP or UDP flows.
.It Ar proto Xo
.Oo !\& Oc
.Ar <protocol>
.Xc
This rule only applies for flows whose protocol matches that specified.
Protocols may be specified by name (tcp, udp, icmp, etc) or by number.
.It Ar tos Xo
.Oo !\& Oc
.Ar <tos>
.Xc
This rule only applies for flows whose type-of-service (ToS) matches that
specified.
The
.It Ar tos Xo
.Oo !\& Oc
.Ar <tos>
.Xc
may be specified as a decimal or hexidecimal number.
.It Ar tcp_flags Xo
.Op Ar mask <mask>
.Oo !\& Oc
.Ar equals <flags>
.Xc
This rule only applies for TCP flows where the accumulated TCP flags seen over
the lifetime of the flow match
the
.Ar flags
specified.
If a
.Ar mask
is specified, the flags checked are the logical AND of the accumulated TCP flags
and the mask.
The
.Ar mask
and
.Ar flags
may be specified as decimal or hexidecimal numbers.
NB. This clause may only be applied to rules matching TCP flows.
.It Ar days Ar <day> | <day>-<day> | Xo
.Sm off
.Ar <day>
.Oo ,\&<day> Oo ,\&... Oc Oc
.Sm on
.Xc
This rule only applies for flows received on the specified days of the week.
Days may be selected as a comma separated list of names (e.g. 
.Ar monday,tuesday,wednesday )
or as a hyphen separated range.
Abbreviations are allowed, e.g.
.Ar mon-fri .
.It Ar after Xo
.Sm off
.Ar <HH:MM
.Oo :SS Oc >
.Sm on
.Xc
This rule only applies for flows received after the specified time of day.
.It Ar before Xo
.Sm off
.Ar <HH:MM
.Oo :SS Oc >
.Sm on
.Xc
This rule only applies for flows received before the specified time of day.
.It Ar after date Xo
.Sm off
.Ar <YYYY
.Oo MMDD 
.Oo HHMM
.Oo SS Oc Oc Oc >
.Sm on
.Xc
This rule only applies for flows received after the specified date / time.
.It Ar before date Xo
.Sm off
.Ar <YYYY
.Oo MMDD 
.Oo HHMM
.Oo SS Oc Oc Oc >
.Sm on
.Xc
This rule only applies for flows received before the specified date / time.
.El
.Pp
This is an example of the filtering language in action:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# Immediately discard all flowd from unknown agents
discard quick agent ! 192.2.0.254
# Perform classification of local traffic
accept tag 1 src 192.0.2.0/24 dst 192.0.2.0/24
# Classification of inbound traffic
accept tag 2 dst 192.0.2.0/24
# Classification of outbound traffic
accept tag 3 src 192.0.2.0/24
# Classification of web traffic
accept tag 0x100 dst any port 80 proto tcp
accept tag 0x100 src any port 80 proto tcp
# Ignore all but one hosts' traffic to a specific port
discard src ! 192.2.0.33 dst any port 12345 proto tcp
# Ignore unestablished TCP flows (ACK = 0x10, SYN = 0x02)
discard proto tcp tcp_flags mask 0x12 !equals 0x12
# Tag flows received during business hours
accept days Monday-Friday after 08:30:00 before 17:30:00
# Ignore flows sent on weekends
discard days Sat,Sun
# Ignore flows sent outside a certain date/time range
discard after date 20051123 before date 20051124084459
# Ignore flows coming in interface 10
